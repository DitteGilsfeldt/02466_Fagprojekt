    "Hello, I have this project description: \"Title: Organ failure following cardiac surgery ‚Äì the use of AI for prediction modelling. Supervisors: Lars Gr√∏nlykke and Theis Skovgaard Itenov (Rigshospitalet), Morten M√∏rup Motivation A series of risk scores exist for cardiac surgery. The most widely used are The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE 2) and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Risk Score. Such risk scores are designed to give the best overall estimates of complication rates, but they lack precision in estimating the risk for the individual patient. Despite these shortcomings these risk scores are still used daily as clinical decision guidance, to provide information to the patient regarding the risk of surgery and to optimize resources in the intensive care unit after surgery. Another drawback to the current risk scores is that they are typically designed to predict mortality, but not morbidity. Project description Every year 1800 patients undergo cardiac surgery at Rigshospitalet. A significant part of these will experience complications that will keep them hospitalized for longer and potentially be fatal. In this project, we will investigate whether AI can be utilized to create more precise prediction models and if it is possible to detect complications earlier. This should ultimately lead to tools that can guide the clinicians, but also the patients when deciding on surgery. Another potential benefit is the better use of resources in the intensive care unit handling these patients postoperatively.\" And I would like to find some relevant key-search words for upcoming research of the project. Can you recommend some?\n",

    "im working with a total of 15 csv files. All these files has an id number that connects all the data. How should i go about handling this data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling multiple CSV files with a common ID number can be done effectively using **pandas**. Let's break down the steps to manage your data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the CSV Files**:\n",
    "   - Read each of your 15 CSV files into separate pandas DataFrames. You can use the `pd.read_csv()` function for this.\n",
    "   - For example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Read CSV files (adjust file paths accordingly)\n",
    "     df1 = pd.read_csv(\"file1.csv\")\n",
    "     df2 = pd.read_csv(\"file2.csv\")\n",
    "     # ... (repeat for other files)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - Inspect the data in each DataFrame to understand its structure, column names, and any missing values.\n",
    "   - Perform any necessary data cleaning, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, or converting data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Merge DataFrames**:\n",
    "   - Since all your CSV files share a common ID number, you can merge them based on this ID.\n",
    "   - Use the `pd.merge()` function to combine DataFrames. Specify the common column (ID) as the key for merging.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Merge two DataFrames based on the 'id' column\n",
    "     merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='id', how='inner')\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat for All Files**:\n",
    "   - Repeat the merging process for all 15 DataFrames. You can create a loop or use a list of DataFrames to simplify the process.\n",
    "   - Adjust the merge strategy (`how`) based on your requirements (inner, outer, left, or right join).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Once you have a single DataFrame containing data from all files, you can perform various analyses, aggregations, and visualizations.\n",
    "   - Explore relationships between columns, calculate summary statistics, and create plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Save the Merged Data**:\n",
    "   - If needed, save the merged DataFrame to a new CSV file for further analysis or sharing.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     merged_df.to_csv(\"combined_data.csv\", index=False)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to adapt the code snippets above to your specific file paths, column names, and data requirements. With pandas, you can efficiently manage and analyze your data across multiple CSV files. üêçüìä\n",
