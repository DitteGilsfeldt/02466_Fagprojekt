    "Hello, I have this project description: \"Title: Organ failure following cardiac surgery â€“ the use of AI for prediction modelling. Supervisors: Lars GrÃ¸nlykke and Theis Skovgaard Itenov (Rigshospitalet), Morten MÃ¸rup Motivation A series of risk scores exist for cardiac surgery. The most widely used are The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE 2) and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Risk Score. Such risk scores are designed to give the best overall estimates of complication rates, but they lack precision in estimating the risk for the individual patient. Despite these shortcomings these risk scores are still used daily as clinical decision guidance, to provide information to the patient regarding the risk of surgery and to optimize resources in the intensive care unit after surgery. Another drawback to the current risk scores is that they are typically designed to predict mortality, but not morbidity. Project description Every year 1800 patients undergo cardiac surgery at Rigshospitalet. A significant part of these will experience complications that will keep them hospitalized for longer and potentially be fatal. In this project, we will investigate whether AI can be utilized to create more precise prediction models and if it is possible to detect complications earlier. This should ultimately lead to tools that can guide the clinicians, but also the patients when deciding on surgery. Another potential benefit is the better use of resources in the intensive care unit handling these patients postoperatively.\" And I would like to find some relevant key-search words for upcoming research of the project. Can you recommend some?\n",
