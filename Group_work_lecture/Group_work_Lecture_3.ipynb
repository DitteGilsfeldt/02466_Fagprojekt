    "\"Title: Organ failure following cardiac surgery – the use of AI for prediction modelling. Supervisors: Lars Grønlykke and Theis Skovgaard Itenov (Rigshospitalet), Morten Mørup Motivation\n",
    "A series of risk scores exist for cardiac surgery. The most widely used are The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE 2) and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Risk Score. Such risk scores are designed to give the best overall estimates of complication rates, but they lack precision in estimating the risk for the individual patient. Despite these shortcomings these risk scores are still used daily as clinical decision guidance, to provide information to the patient regarding the risk of surgery and to optimize resources in the intensive care unit after surgery. Another drawback to the current risk scores is that they are typically designed to predict mortality, but not morbidity.\n",
    "Project description\n",
    "Every year 1800 patients undergo cardiac surgery at Rigshospitalet. A significant part of these will experience complications that will keep them hospitalized for longer and potentially be fatal. In this project, we will investigate whether AI can be utilized to create more precise prediction models and if it is possible to detect complications earlier. This should ultimately lead to tools that can guide the clinicians, but also the patients when deciding on surgery. Another potential benefit is the better use of resources in the intensive care unit handling these patients postoperatively.\"\n",

    "Certainly! Crafting a list of key search terms will help you navigate through a vast amount of literature efficiently. For your project on using AI for prediction modeling in the context of organ failure following cardiac surgery, consider these search terms and phrases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiac Surgery Complications - To find studies or data on common postoperative complications.\n",
    "AI in Healthcare - Broad term to find applications of AI within the healthcare sector.\n",
    "Machine Learning Models in Medicine - More specific to the application of machine learning techniques in medical diagnosis and prognosis.\n",
    "Predictive Analytics in Cardiology - To find research related to predictive analytics specifically in the field of cardiology.\n",
    "Postoperative Care Optimization - To explore strategies and technologies used in improving post-surgical care.\n",
    "EuroSCORE 2 - For literature on the most widely used cardiac surgery risk score.\n",
    "STS Risk Score - To find information on the Society of Thoracic Surgeons' approach to assessing surgical risk.\n",
    "Patient-specific Risk Assessment - For studies on individualized risk assessment methods.\n",
    "Early Detection of Cardiac Surgery Complications - To identify methods for early complication detection.\n",
    "Deep Learning in Clinical Decision Support - Specifically looking at deep learning applications in supporting clinical decisions.\n",
    "Intensive Care Unit Resource Optimization - For strategies on ICU resource management, particularly after cardiac surgery.\n",

    "These terms can be combined or adjusted based on the specific focus at different stages of your project. For example, combining \"AI in Healthcare\" with \"Predictive Analytics in Cardiology\" might narrow down search results to AI applications in cardiac risk assessment. Similarly, integrating \"Deep Learning\" with \"Outcome Prediction in Cardiac Surgery\" could help find cutting-edge research on using deep learning models for post-surgery outcomes.\n",
